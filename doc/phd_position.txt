Open positions in Blockchain and key management
-------------------------------------------------------

The Cybersecurity Lab at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, has multiple job openings for PhD students on the topic of blockchain and cryptographic key management. The salary is 27K ~ 37K AUD per year, tax free.

## Institution

Monash is one of the prestigious "Group of Eight" universities in Australia, and is ranked 59th in the world according to the 2017 QS world university rankings. The PhD candidates will be part of the Cybersecurity Lab (https://www.monash.edu/cybersecurity-lab) at Monash University, working with Dr. Jiangshan Yu. The Cybersecurity Lab has been supported by Australian Research Council (ARC), Data 61 and a number of industry partners. It has strong collaboration between academics, industries and governments, both locally and internationally.

## Our research

The focus of our research has been on design and analysis of cryptographic protocols, cryptographic key management, blockchain consensus and blockchain analysis, and ledger-based applications. For example, our research on blockchain consensus, called RepuCoin, provides the first blockchain system that is able to tolerate 51% attacks. This system may save potentially millions of US dollars every month from the attacks, and increase the confidence of enterprise in adapting blockchains. (For example, from April 2018 to Feb 2019, at least ten successful 51% attacks are identified, with a total loss of over 28 million US dollars.) This work has been reported by over 60 news media globally including Monash News, Finder, 今日头条(Toutiao), ZDNet, Sohu, BTC Wires, ScienceDaily, Ethereum World News, EurekAlert!, The US Breaking news, Homeland Security Today, etc.

Potential PhD research topics include but are not limited to:

1. Blockchain consensus, including research in cryptocurrency and smart contract.
2. Blockchain security and privacy, including system analysis and attacks.
3. Blockchain Network evaluation and analysis.
4. (Adversarial) Machine learning in Blockchain.
5. Cryptographic key management and authentication.

## Requirements

- A master degree in a relevant topic, with GPA >80/100. Outstanding students with only undergraduate degree can also be considered, if GPA > 90/100.

- Outstanding English skills, e.g., IELTS 6.5 overall (no band less than 6.0), TOEFL IBT 79 + (Reading 13, Listening 12, Speaking 18 & Writing 21)
